   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. If not, [install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

### Using Docker

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:userpassword@db:3306/tweetai
   ```

   - `user`: MySQL username
   - `userpassword`: MySQL password
   - `db`: Service name for the MySQL container
   - `tweetai`: Database name

2. **Start the Containers**

   Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will:
   - Build the Docker image for your application.
   - Start the MySQL and application containers.

3. **Access the Application**

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Without Docker (Development Mode)

If you prefer running the application without Docker:

1. **Install MySQL Locally**

   Install and configure MySQL on your local machine.

2. **Update Database Configuration**

   Update the database configuration in your Nest.js application to connect to your local MySQL instance.

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

   This command will start the Nest.js application in development mode.
